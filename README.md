# dotfiles
THE BEST cobbled together config files that I use IN THE WORLD!!!

Just the stuff I use. Definitely not the best, but not the worst.

Window managers configs (sway and i3) are heavily modified versions of Manjaro's i3 flavor.
Neovim config is a modified version of MrSobakin's nvim config.

Probably should look through them and remove stuff I don't need, but well, I'm lazy.
